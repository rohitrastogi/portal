# Wildhacks Registration Portal

### Installation & Setup
- `git clone https://github.com/NUWildHacks/portal.git`
- Navigate to the cloned folder, and run `npm install` to install required dependencies
- Run `bower install` to download the assets, specified in `bower.json`. 
- Setup your local MongoDB database. Mongo has some (pretty good documentation)[https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/installation/] on that.
- Setup your local development environment. Ask one of your fave tech buds to provide you with environment variables. You won't be able to run the project without them.

### Running
- In the root project folder in your terminal, run `npm run watch` or `gulp`. Either one will compile all of your assets and restart your server if any changes were made.
- In your browser, head over to `localhost:3000` to view the web application.
